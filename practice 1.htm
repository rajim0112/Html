    <p style="background-color: beige;"> The circuit is designed to indicate three levels of water stored in the tank: low but not empty, half and full but not
        overflowing. When there is no water in the tank, all the LEDs are off as an indication that the tank is completely
        empty. When water level increases and touches the sensor, the Red LED will glow indicating that there is water
        within the tank. As the water level continues to rise and reaches half the tank, Yellow LED will glow. When the
        water in the tank rises to full an alarm is made by the buzzer as an indication that the tank is full</p>
