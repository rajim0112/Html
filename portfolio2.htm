            <li><span>Design a robust controller for the load frequency of interconnected power system</span><br></br>This project aims to develop a robust controller of (1+PD)-PID cascade controller for the frequency stabilization 
                of multi-area interconnected power system. The operational performance of the proposed controller is studied
                by laying the step load disturbance of 10% in the area-1 of the considered power system model. For the fine
                tuning of the proposed controller, Butterfly optimization algorithm is considered. However, the superiority
                performance of the proposed controller is validated with other controllers available in the literature. Further, to
                obtain the improvement in the power system performance the high voltage DC line is implemented with the test
                system model. The simulation results confirmed the improvement in the system performance with
                the incorporation of the HVDC line. To check the robustness of the proposed controller, the sensitivity test is
                conducted and validated the robustness.

            <li><span>Water Level Indicator</span><br></br>The circuit is designed to indicate three levels of water stored in the tank: low but not empty, half and full but not
                overflowing. When there is no water in the tank, all the LEDs are off as an indication that the tank is completely
                empty. When water level increases and touches the sensor, the Red LED will glow indicating that there is water
                within the tank. As the water level continues to rise and reaches half the tank, Yellow LED will glow. When the
                water in the tank rises to full an alarm is made by the buzzer as an indication that the tank is full.
